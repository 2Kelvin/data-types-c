C has 2 categories of data, **floating points** and **integers**:
- **Floating points**
    - [x] `float` -> small decimal place
    - [x] `double` -> larger and more decimal place than a float
- **Integers**
    - [x] `short` -> can store thousands of numbers (lesser than int)
    - [x] `long` -> can store billion of numbers (greater than an int)
    - [x] `int` -> can store a million numbers
    - [x] `char` -> stores alphabet characters in ASCII (number) format

In C **chars are actually numbers because they are stored in memory in their ASCII code format** e.g. A == 65, a = 97
